		"A few additional things of note:$(li)For the sake of consistency and effeciency, the timer is based on time from Jan 1, 1970, so you can set up the delay to be 1h and have it re-randomize less than 5m after you set up the rule if that goes past the 1h mark.$(li)The randomized range is from -X% -> X%, so there is a chance for the price to randomize at +0% and use the default price.",
		"$(li)Even if applied to all trades each trades price will be randomized seperately (within the same range of course). This means that trade 1 could randomly be +5% and trade 2 be at -3% from the same trade rule."
