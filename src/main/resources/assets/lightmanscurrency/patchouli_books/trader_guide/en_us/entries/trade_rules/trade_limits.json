		"Now that is where the similarities end. The normal \"Trade Limit\" rule applies to all players equally, and only allows the given number of trade/trader interactions period. Once that limit has been reached the trade/trader can no longer be interacted with at all by any player.$(br2) Now the \"Player Trade Limit\" rule is a bit more flexible and only limits each customer from interacting with the trade more than the given amount of times.",
